// countries-110m.json rather than land-110m.json, which is where this started and
// which draws the same coastline: this file carries a `land` object of its own
// *and* the per-country geometry, built from one shared set of arcs. Two files
// would have given the highlight a coastline simplified independently of the
// silhouette it is painted on, and disagreements of a pixel would show as a
// fringe of unshaded land along the coast of every highlighted country.

// Usage: node tools/worldmap.mjs [countries-110m.json]
